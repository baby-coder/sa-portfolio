            I ventured out to the real world to pursue a career in robotics and automation, developing software for automation of Testbed facilities in Automotive, Industrial R&D, Defense, Academia, Locomotive sectors. I worked for 4 years and acquired hands-on experience with wide range of sensors and automation tools. It was during this time I got fascinated by the concept of Industrial Internet / Internet of Things / Cyber-physical systems.It was a global craze and I wanted to stand-out by learning about the security aspect of gathered data. Having explored the corporate space for a while, I completed my Masters in Computer Engineering at Iowa State University learning more about embedded systems security in IoT applications while researching in the security of Smart Grids / Cyber-physical systems.
